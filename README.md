React Router Tutorial
=====================

This forked repository contains changes in [Lesson 13 - Server Rendering](/lessons/13-server-rendering/). That code corresponds actually to the result of [Lesson 12 - Navigating](/lessons/12-navigating/), which can be considered the end of the tutorial if you exclude the Server Rendering part.

The changes enable the deployment in a different root other than "/". That would be useful if you are e.g. composing multiple servers and you want them to have different roots.

Quick lessons for getting up-to-speed with React Router.

See [Lesson 1 - Setting Up](/lessons/01-setting-up/) to get started.

Each lesson is a fully runnable app with all code from the previous lesson, so you can `cd lessons/<lesson-folder>`, npm install,
and then run the appropriate NPM scripts for each lesson from within the lesson folder.

Missing stuff that will come eventually, hopefully ... maybe.
